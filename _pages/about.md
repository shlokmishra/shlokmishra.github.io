## About

I am a final-year undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK) majoring in Statistics and Data Science, with minors in Machine Learning and Philosophy.
My research interests lie at the intersection of computational statistics and machine learning. I am advised by [Dr. Dootika Vats](https://dvats.github.io/) at IITK, whose guidance has significantly shaped my research trajectory.
